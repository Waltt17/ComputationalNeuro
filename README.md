# Neuro

ComputationalNeuro_1
Calculates spike raster plots, perstimulus time histogram, spike rate, autocorrelation, crosscorrelation

ComputationalNeuro_2
Calculates seconds of data, autocorrelation, filter is included in the github, it filters the data two different ways

ComputationalNeuro_3
Calculates crosscorrelation, more filters with plotting of data, spiking rate, peristimulus time histogram, and lastly it calculates the 
optimal direction for firing rate and then the sub-optimal firing rate for a given equation
